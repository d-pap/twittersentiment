# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project

This is a data analysis project that involves loading a dataset of tweets, exploring the data, cleaning and preprocessing the text, and then using machine learning to classify the tweets as either positive or negative. The project uses the Pandas library and NLTK library for data manipulation, Matplotlib for data visualization, and scikit-learn for building the machine learning model. The resulting model is able to classify tweets with an accuracy of around 90%.

This project was done to learn how I could analyze a companies social media presence and predict customer's sentiment. It can be helpful for a company by doing this process automatically instead of manually reviewing thousands of tweets or customer reviews. 

# My Process

Project Outline:
  1. Imported libraries and datasets
  2. Performed exploratory data analysis and generated word clouds from the dataset
  4. Performed data cleaning and created a pipeline to remove punctuations, stop words, and perform tokenization
  5. Trained a Naive Bayes Classifier model
  6. Assessed the trained model's performance
